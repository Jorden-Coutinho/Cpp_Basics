**About This Repository**
This repository contains a curated collection of C++ programs developed as part of an academic curriculum during college coursework. These programs are designed to reinforce and deepen the understanding of core programming concepts, problem-solving techniques, and the foundational principles of the C++ programming language.

Each file in this repository represents a specific topic or concept, ranging from basic syntax and control structures to more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and file handling. These examples are especially useful for beginners looking to gain hands-on experience, as well as for anyone seeking to revisit or solidify their C++ fundamentals.


**Compiler Information
Important Note on Compatibility**
The programs in this repository were originally written and tested using the Turbo C++ compiler, which was commonly used in educational settings for many years. As a result, some of the code may rely on legacy libraries or compiler-specific conventions (such as conio.h or graphics.h) that are not supported in modern development environments like GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio.

If you intend to run these programs in a modern IDE or online compiler, you may need to modify certain parts of the code to ensure compatibility. This might include:
* Replacing deprecated headers and functions
* Adapting syntax to match current C++ standards (C++11 or later)
* Removing or updating DOS-specific commands such as getch(), clrscr(), etc.

I recommend using a modern C++ compiler where possible and refactoring code accordingly for long-term maintainability.


**Usage and Contributions**
You are welcome to explore, use, and modify the programs in this repository for your personal learning, academic assignments, or experimentation. If you find any bugs, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement, feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request.
